# Logistic-regression-dimensionality-reduction
Using the principle component analysis to find the two main features to represent the 13 variaous wine charasteristics and develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer types using the two features as the inputs.  

# Problem statement

A wine company collected the 13 features of their wine products, also its marketing team cluster their target customers into three types. The company looking for a model to find the hidden characteristics that determine the customer type, and develop the model to help the marketing team to recognize the future customer type. 

# Data
The data resource is from the UCI machine learning repository.
Dataset containing 13 features and the customer segment information.
The partialy screenshot is shown below:


# Reduce the features
## 
The principle to reduce the 13 features of the wine products to less is by finding the hidden layers that can explain the most of the features variance. In this case, principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to project the 13 varibales into smaller dimensional subspace.
